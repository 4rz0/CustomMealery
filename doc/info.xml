 	<element name="Config files">
 	    When first starting the mod, a "_template.json" file will be created inside the
 	    "config/custommealery" folder. This will contain an example of all the possible
 	    configuration options for food. The following examples will be for the Minecraft
 	    1.6 release, the differences with 1.7 can be found in the
 	    wiki: https://github.com/rubensworks/CustomMealery/wiki
 	    
 	    When you define your own food, you can use any folder structure you want, as long
 	    as it resides in the "config/custommealery" folder and ends with ".json".
 	    (All files not ending with ".json" or with "_" as a prefix will be ignored.)
 	    
 	    Some things that can be defined:
[list]
[*] Textures, including animations + color overlays.
[*] Eat time
[*] Saturation
[*] Is wolf food
[*] Rarity color
[*] Amount of bites for one item (damage values)
[*] Enchantment effect for icon overlay
[*] Is always edible
[*] Maximum stack size
[*] Potion effects when eaten
[*] Crafting recipe
[*] Furnace recipe
[/list]

            This is an example of a complex recipe that uses item id's, sometimes with
            meta values and ore dictionary keys.

            Furnace recipes can also easily be added like this:

    furnaceRecipe: {
        recipeResultAmount: 4,
        inputid: 264,
        inputmeta: 3,
        experience: 4
    }

		<element name="Damage values" img="CtsedCh">
            Do you want your food to be able to be eaten in multiple bites?
            Just add a line like this to set it to eight bites per item.

    damageValue: 8,
